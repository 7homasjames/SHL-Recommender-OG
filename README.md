# ðŸ§  SHL Assessment Recommender

This project is an intelligent recommender system that extracts job descriptions from SHL product catalog pages and suggests relevant SHL assessments using a Large Language Model (LLM). It supports both full URLs and slugs as input and returns a structured markdown table with the most relevant SHL assessments.

---

## âœ… Solution Overview

### 1. Frontend Interface
- **Tool**: `Streamlit`
- Provides a simple UI for users to input:
  - A full SHL job description URL
  - A job slug (identifier string)

### 2. Web Scraping
- **Libraries**: `Selenium`, `BeautifulSoup`
- **Steps**:
  - Launch a Chrome browser using Selenium
  - Load and extract HTML from the given URL
  - Parse and clean the HTML body using BeautifulSoup (remove scripts/styles)

### 3. Text Chunking
- Cleaned HTML content is split into chunks (max 6000 characters) to respect LLM token limits.

### 4. Prompt Engineering + LLM Parsing
- **Libraries**: `LangChain`, `OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo`
- Prompts the LLM to extract:
  - Most likely job title
  - Top 10 SHL assessments relevant to the job
  - A markdown table with: assessment name, URL, remote testing, adaptive/IRT support, duration, and type

### 5. Displaying Results
- **Streamlit UI** shows:
  - Cleaned job description (for transparency)
  - Markdown-formatted assessment table
